# android-gpstracking-tests
Some tests with different types of GPS tracking services.

# Usage
Fusion API: In app menu, choose Start. When you are done with the test, choose Stop. A file named location_gpstracking.zip will be created at Download directory with the log of your locations updates.

Classic mode (with Context.LOCATION_SERVICE): In app menu, choose Start Offline. When you are done with the test, choose Stop Offline. A file named location_offline_gpstracking.zip will be created at Download directory with the log of your locations updates.

# Objective of the test
Seems that the Fusion API needs the internet to get some fixes. With this app you can test both mode to help you take the decision in with one is the best for you.
