# android-gpstracking-tests
Some tests with different types of GPS tracking services.

# Usage
Fusion API: In app menu, choose Start. When you are done with the test, choose Stop. A file named location_gpstracking.zip will be created at Download directory with the log of your locations updates.

Classic mode (with Context.LOCATION_SERVICE): In app menu, choose Start Offline. When you are done with the test, choose Stop Offline. A file named location_offline_gpstracking.zip will be created at Download directory with the log of your locations updates.

# Tests objective
Seems that the Fusion API needs internet to get some fixes. This app will help you to test both modes so you can decide which one is the the best choice.
